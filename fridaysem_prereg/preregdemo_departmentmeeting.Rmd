# Tips `r emo::ji("bulb")`
--

Don't have clear hypotheses? Consider exploratory study to derive hypotheses.

--

Try to estimate your effect size (e.g., meta-analysis).

--

Run power analysis to calculate required N to detect effect size.

--

Ask colleagues to review your preregistration.

--

Find a preregistration that fits your planned study, use as template.

--

The more detailed the prereg, the better. But start with small steps.

--

Increase power by preregistering one-tailed tests (http://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2016/03/one-sided-tests-efficient-and-underused.html).

###Preregistration anxiety is real, in the beginning. But don't let that kill your research joy! 

###Exploration and deviation should be expected. Preregistration simply makes this clear.
